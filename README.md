## Introduction

This application integrates Spotify's OAuth 2.0 flow to allow users to log in securely with their Spotify accounts. Once authenticated, users can access Spotify data based on the scopes requested during the authorization process.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to log in to their Spotify accounts securely.
- **Access Token Management**: Handles access tokens to make authorized API calls to Spotify.
- **Authorization Code Flow**: Implements the authorization code flow for secure and long-lived sessions.

## Setup

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- React (create-react-app or similar)
- Spotify Developer Account (for client ID and client secret)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd project-directory
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/
   ```

   Replace `your_spotify_client_id` with your actual Spotify client ID obtained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

## Usage

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` (or your specified port).

3. **Log in with Spotify**:

   Click on the "Login to Spotify" button to initiate the authentication flow. You will be redirected to Spotify's login page to authorize the application.

4. **Access Spotify Data**:

   After successful authentication, the application will retrieve an access token. This token can be used to make authorized API requests to Spotify, depending on the scopes requested.
